# 🧠 Finvestor – AI-Driven Stock Trading System

**Finvestor** is an advanced, AI-powered trading assistant designed to analyze historical and real-time market data, calculate key technical indicators, and make intelligent decisions about when to buy or sell stocks — down to the exact second. Inspired by institutional-grade systems like BlackRock's Aladdin, Finvestor is built to exceed their scope through open, modular, and transparent design.
